<p>SOUPIIR is a French creative studio somewhere between a lab, a mirage, and a film set.</p>
<p>Founded by director Bertrand Touchard, it blends real and unreal, poetry and code, chaos and precision.</p>

<p>We use AI not as a shortcut, but as a lens — to stretch reality, distort time, and invent emotions that didn’t exist before.</p>
<p>From surreal music videos to fake fashion collections, dance films to brand experiments, we craft bold, unexpected visual worlds.</p>
<p>Always with one rule: surprise the eye, and speak to something deeper.</p>

<p>SOUPIIR comes from le soupir.</p>
<p>A breath. A pause. A glitch in the system.</p>
<p>A space between two beats — where strange things have room to appear.</p>

<p>We’ve collaborated with artists like DJ Snake, Mino, Bekar or Matt Huncke — crafting visual stories that don’t just decorate the music, but haunt it.</p>

<p>The style?</p>
<p>It mutates.</p>
<p>But often: cinematic without cinema, poetic without poems, beautiful without being polite.</p>
<p>A blend of skin and algorithm.</p>
<p>Of ghosts, colors, noise, and silence.</p>
<p>Of that thing you saw once, but can't quite describe.</p>
