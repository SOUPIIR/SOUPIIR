<div><strong>SOUPIIR</strong> is a French creative studio somewhere between a lab, a mirage, and a film set.<br />
It blends the real and the unreal, poetry and code, chaos and precision.</div>

<div>We use AI not as a shortcut but as a lens — to stretch reality, distort time, and trigger sensations you can’t quite name.<br />
From surreal music videos to fake fashion collections, from dance films to brand experiments, we craft bold, unexpected visual worlds.<br />
Always with one rule: surprise the eye, and speak to something deeper.</div>

<div><strong>SOUPIIR</strong> comes from the French word soupir, meaning sigh.<br />
A breath. A pause. A glitch in the system.<br />
A space between two beats where strange things have room to appear.</div>

<div>From global icons to underground talents, we collaborate across music, culture and brands: DJ Snake, Don Toliver, Bekar, Matt Huncke, Mino Collective...</div>

<div>The style?<br />
It mutates.<br />
But often: cinematic without cinema, poetic without poems, beautiful without asking for approval.<br />
A blend of skin and algorithm.<br />
Of ghosts, colors, noise, and silence.<br />
Of that thing you saw once, but can't quite describe.</div>
