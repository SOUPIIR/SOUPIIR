        <strong>SOUPIIR</strong> is a French creative studio somewhere between a lab, a mirage, and a film set.<br />
        It blends the real and the unreal, poetry and code, chaos and precision.
    </div>

    <div>We work across formats and techniques, mixing live action, CGI, AI, and design to shape visual worlds that feel both precise and unpredictable. From music videos to commercials, from cultural capsules to experimental campaigns, we create bold, unexpected experiences. Always with one rule: surprise the eye, and speak to something deeper.</div>

    <div>
        <strong>SOUPIIR</strong> comes from the French word soupir, meaning sigh.<br />
        A breath. A pause. A glitch in the system.<br />
        A space between two beats where strange things have room to appear.
    </div>

    <div>From global icons to underground talents, we collaborate across music, culture and brands: DJ Snake, Don Toliver, Bekar, Matt Huncke, Sens Unik, Mino Collective...</div>

    <div>
        The style?<br />
        It mutates.<br />
        But often: cinematic without cinema, poetic without poems, beautiful without asking for approval.<br />
        A blend of skin and algorithm.<br />
        Of ghosts, colors, noise, and silence.<br />
        Of that thing you saw once, but can't quite describe.
