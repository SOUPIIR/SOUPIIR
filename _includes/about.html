<div><strong>SOUPIIR</strong> is a French creative studio somewhere between a lab, a mirage, and a film set.<br />
It blends real and unreal, poetry and code, chaos and precision.</div>

<div>We use AI not as a shortcut, but as a lens — to stretch reality, distort time, and invent emotions that didn’t exist before.<br />
From surreal music videos to fake fashion collections, dance films to brand experiments, we craft bold, unexpected visual worlds.<br />
Always with one rule: surprise the eye, and speak to something deeper.</div>

<div><strong>SOUPIIR</strong> comes from le soupir.<br />
A breath. A pause. A glitch in the system.<br />
A space between two beats — where strange things have room to appear.</div>

<div>We’ve collaborated with artists like DJ Snake, Mino, Bekar or Matt Huncke — crafting visual stories that don’t just decorate the music, but haunt it.</div>

<div>The style?<br />
It mutates.<br />
But often: cinematic without cinema, poetic without poems, beautiful without being polite.<br />
A blend of skin and algorithm.<br />
Of ghosts, colors, noise, and silence.<br />
Of that thing you saw once, but can't quite describe.</div>
